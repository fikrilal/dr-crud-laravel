## **⚡ Development Velocity Strategies**

### **Speed Optimizations:**
1. **Template-First Approach** - Copy Sneat templates, then add logic
2. **Component Reuse** - Shared header/sidebar/footer across pages
3. **Direct SQL** - No ORM overhead, direct prepared statements
4. **AJAX Enhancement** - Add dynamic features incrementally
5. **Parallel Development** - Work on independent features simultaneously

### **Risk Mitigation:**
1. **Core First** - Authentication and database foundation before features
2. **Incremental Testing** - Test each feature as it's completed
3. **Fallback Plans** - Simplify features if timeline pressures arise
4. **Documentation** - Clear architecture prevents development delays

## **📋 Task Dependencies**

### **Critical Path:**
```
Database Setup → Core Classes → Authentication → User Management → 
Drug Management → Sales System → Testing
```

### **Parallel Development Opportunities:**
- Supplier Management (parallel with Drug Management)
- Customer Portal (parallel with Reporting)
- UI Polish (parallel with Testing)

---

## **🔄 Agile Approach**

### **Daily Standups:**
- **Yesterday:** What was completed
- **Today:** Current focus and goals  
- **Blockers:** Any impediments to progress

### **Sprint Reviews:**
- **Day 3:** Review core functionality
- **Day 5:** Review business features
- **Day 7:** Final demonstration

### **Adaptability:**
- Features can be simplified if timeline pressures arise
- UI polish is flexible based on available time
- Reporting complexity can be reduced for MVP
